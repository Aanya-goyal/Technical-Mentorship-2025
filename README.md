# Technical Mentorship 2025

</div>

Welcome to the Technical Mentorship 2025 repository! This is your space to learn, practice, and grow your programming skills through hands-on problem solving.

## Problem Statements

You need to solve the following **4 programming challenges**:

1. **Armstrong Number** - Check if a number is an Armstrong number (sum of cubes of digits equals the number itself)
2. **Bubble Sort** - Implement the bubble sort algorithm to sort an array
3. **Binary Search** - Implement binary search to find an element in a sorted array
4. **Matrix Multiplication** - Multiply two matrices and display the result

## Repository Structure
